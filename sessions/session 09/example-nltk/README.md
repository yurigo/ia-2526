# Text Generation with NLTK and Markovify

## nltk

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful library for natural language processing in Python. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

```bash
pip install nltk
```

## markovify

Markovify is a simple and extensible Markov chain generator. It is designed to be easy to use and allows for the creation of random text based on the statistical properties of a given text corpus.

```bash
pip install markovify
```
